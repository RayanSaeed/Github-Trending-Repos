# Github Trending Repositories (iOS App)

A simple single screen app which shows the current trending Github repositories fetched from a public API.
The app has been built using Swift and UIKit with iOS 13 as the deployment target. 
This was built using **Test Driven Development** (`TDD`) and MVVM was used as the architecture of choice for this simple app. The `code coverage` for this app is `87.1%`

The fetched JSON data is cached using `URLCache`. The user can fetch fresh data by pulling down on the table view to refresh.
